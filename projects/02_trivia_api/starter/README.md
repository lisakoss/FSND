# Full Stack Trivia
This project is a trivia game where users can test their knowledge by answering questions in different categories! The goals of this project was to create an API that supports the following:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

All backend code follows [PEP 8 style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites & Local Development
Developers should already have Python3, pip, and node installed on their local machines.

### Frontend 
This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment for Backend
Navigate to your `/backend` directory and set up your virtual envrioment by running the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. 

### Backend
Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Running the Server
From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

### Running the Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute (omit the dropdb command if running for the first time):

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python3 test_flaskr.py
```

## API Reference
### Getting Started
* Base URL: This backend application can only be ran locally and is not hosted at a base URL. The backend is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set in the frontend configuration.
* Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling 
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```bash
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 400,
    "message": "Bad request"
}
```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:
* 400 Bad request
* 404 Resource not found
* 422 Unprocessable
